      <h3>Teeth Cleaning & Scaling</h3>
        <p>At Sakthi Dental Clinic, we offer advanced, non-surgical gum care using modern LASER 
technology for precise and effective treatment. Whether you're dealing with early signs of gum 
disease or a more advanced condition, our skilled professionals ensure thorough cleaning to 
restore gum health. Scaling is advised for moderate cases to remove plaque and tartar buildup, 
while more severe periodontal issues may require deep cleaning procedures like root planing, 
supported by LASER treatment. This approach not only treats existing problems but also serves 
as a crucial preparatory step before any surgical intervention.</p>
